Title: Compares names to databases of misconduct

Description: Download information (currently just from the
    Academic Sexual Misconduct Database (Libarkin 2020)) to match against
    names extracted from other documents. This is to allow easy flagging
    of possible matches (for example, which current members of the
    National Academy of Sciences have been found guilty of misconduct).
    However, there are some important caveats for its use. Name matches
    are uncertain: many people will have the same name, so even a perfect
    match might not be the same individual. There is also the opposite
    issue: some true matches might be missed ("Patricia Smith" in one
    document might not match "Patty Smith" in another). One can change the
    leniency to address the latter problem, though this will result in
    many more false matches. There also needs to be one or more humans
    involved in deciding how to act on any true matches -- for example, it
    may be illegal to exclude any true matches from a pool of job
    candidates. It is also worth considering the impact on past
    convictions: see information on the "ban the box" movement, for
    example. My motivation in developing this package is to help
    scientific societies identify bad actors who have harmed others in
    their organization and use a fair process to decide about possible
    ways to protect their members (banning individuals from attending
    conferences, for example) -- the package can be used for other things,
    many moral, but also some immoral. It is a potentially powerful tool,
    so use it humanely.
